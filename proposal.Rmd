# Proposal for STA 418/518

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r load_packages_data, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

spotify_data <- read_csv(here::here("tracks_features.csv"))
```

Our ultimate goal is to create a Shiny app. We would like to have a searchable box where users can search for an artist and graphs and details about that artist will pop up automatically. 


```{r}
spotify_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = instrumentalness)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = .05, fill = "red")


```
