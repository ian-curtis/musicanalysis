# Goals

## Overall
* Have an efficient Shiny app (searchable)
* Easy for users to use
* Clear explanation of what we did and how to use the app
* Finish data creation
* Extra instrumentalness column

## Ian
* Starting a shiny app
* Import multiple datasets? (DONE)
* Look up what the variables actually measure

## Stacy
* Start running eda again (DONE)
* Looking at random characters (DONE)
* Adding comments to file to explain our decisions

## Sarba
* Make new variable in dataset with just the year (DONE)
* Remove duplicates


# Learning Objectives

How can we show that we are meeting the objectives?

## Import, manage, and clean data

We have shown we can import data and manage it with the `tidyverse`. We will each need to show more on cleaning data because this data is pretty clean.

## Create graphical displays and numerical summaries of data for exploratory analysis and presentations

This is the purpose of the project. We will be creating a lot of graphs and visualizations of our data to show to users.

## Write R programs for simulations from probability models and randomization-based experiments

We will need to show elsewhere probability and simulation.

## Use source documentation and other resources to troubleshoot and extend R programs.

We used a package for basic EDA. This will need to be worked on.

## Write clear, efficient, and well-documented R programs

We will do this. Includes adding comments to explain decisions and what the code does. Can type in comments and in the .rmd text spaces.
